🚀 Lovable Projects Showcase by Jiya Agrawal (Me)

Hi, I’m Jiya – a passionate B.Tech CSE student at GLA University, building beautiful and interactive frontend apps using [Lovable](https://lovable.so) (a no-code UI editor) ✨.

This repository contains a growing list of projects I’ve created using Lovable — quick builds, creative ideas, and fun UI experiments that I turn into working apps within 30–60 minutes during my free time. 🌟


💭 Why Lovable?

Is it good to code from scratch? Absolutely — but sometimes, when a random idea strikes, **speed matters** more than setup! Instead of spending hours on boilerplate code, I use Lovable and just describe the idea as a prompt — and boom 💥 — the UI is generated, editable, and ready to ship!

This repo lists all the projects I’ve made this way — fast, functional, and fun.
